  <h1 align=center><u>MEETING RECAP: 24 JAN 2020</u></h1><br>
  <p>Syllabus week, and figuring out what to expect from a new batch of classes, can get stressful. What a better way to relieve that stress than by playing some pickleball!</p><br><p>It was great to see many returning faces (and even a couple new ones) for our first two hours of social matches. Thanks so much for starting us off with a bang!</p><br><p>(In the future, the top of the News page will feature more comprehensive meeting minutes. You'll get to see our attendance numbers, review any drills we practiced, and maybe even relive the best moments of the evening sometimes...)<br><br>

  <h1 align=center><u>CLUB</u>: Competitive league opportunity</h1><br>
  <p>We are looking to start a competitive pickleball league for those who are interested. Playing competitive matches is hands-down the best way to improve your game. It's also one of the best ways to get to know like-minded players. And who knows - there might just be a jar of pickles up for grabs for our champions...</p><br>
  <p>League play would take place during regular Friday meetings, over a number of weeks, before culminating in a championship round.</p><br>
  <p>There will be no fee and anyone can join, period - regardless of skill level or length of time in the club. All we ask is that you commit to showing up on meetings and match days.</p><br>
  <p>This will be a doubles league. If you have a partner in mind you would like to play with, tell us and have them sign up, too. Partnerships may rotate throughout the semester.</p><br>
  <p>Sign up by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpQwF-lqAjjRgEHsXr1U4mfy1Ka0iQ8DvY1dxWGWK14KyFJg/viewform">this form.</a></p><br><br>

  <h1 align=center><u>GAME</u>: This week's most wholesome pickleball stories</h1><br>
  <p>As pickleball continues to spread across the country, it continues to bring more people together. Two stories in this week's news are no exception.</p><br>
  <p>Jim Berger, a retired Missouri native, served as a former 1st Lieutenant during the Vietnam War. During a routine doubles session at his hometown Y, he found himself partnered with Tri Nguyen, who had resettled in America after serving as a Captain in the former South Vietnamese military. After getting to know each other on the sidelines, the two men soon found just how small the world is: they had fought in the same spot (Hamburger Hill) at the same time. Jim and Tri, thank you both for your service! <a href="https://kmox.radio.com/articles/news/vietnam-war-veterans-reunite-on-missouri-pickleball-courts">Read the story here.</a></p><br>
  <p>Meanwhile in Myrtle Beach, more than 250 players from across the country united at the House of Pickleball for the five-day "Dink for Pink" tournament. Proceeds will be supporting Lump to Laughter, a Christian organization providing spiritual, emotional, and financial support to women battling breast cancer. Over the past four years of the tournament, the House has raised over $100,000 for Lump to Laughter - and they don't intend on stopping. <a href="https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/01/25/pickleball-teams-go-head-to-head-to-support-area-women-with-cancer/">Read the story here.</a></p><br>
